All through my engineering degree, I believed that world has already been figured out. We could Objectify any problem and solve it. Policy-makers/economist/people-who-control-how-we-should-live-our-life knew everything to take right decision.

Fast forward to zoho, I was in for a complete surprise. This is a land of intuitions and non-formalism. All my childhood education was about how wrong my intuitions were and How objectifying problems would give fairer solution.
I poked around things trying to comprehend this new world and get revealed to fact that everything has some fundamental axioms and you had to take a leap of faith on it. Nobody knows truth and we all are in same ship, figuring out from the shoulder of collective generational insights.

I owe a lot of it to humanities. My treatise is that Humanities is the fastest way to the frontier of human knowledge. People generally have to spend years in hard science to actually find gaps in our human knowledge. Reading few months of humanity will show you the cracks on foundations of moral, political, economical structures. Reaching the frontier and seeing that everyone is on same boat gives confidence. you then start forging your own path as you know none knows the answer. It naturally guides human to be more independent and critical thinking. It gives the 'will to carve the nature'.
Whats more? It is actually fun reading humanities than structurally-jargoned technicals. It is fun, interesting and insightful. I dont think there could be more easier way to reach frontier of knowledge.

Humanities guided me form a loosely-held opinion on 'Human Nature' and 'On what is truth?and how to find it?'.
I am convinced this knowledge would be crucial to any person. Our choice of UI, words on campaigns,etc,etc are sort of experiments in subject of Human nature. Truths guides us on how right we are. You could sort of think this as theoretical aspects of our business executions or Ph.D in sales,marketing,PM,support,etc would essentially be papers dealing with human nature XD.
