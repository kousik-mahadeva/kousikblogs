This is user manual on how to approach computation so that you love it.
Computation is actually very interesting subject. It is boring in colleges because we do not get the context.
Random remarks about DFA, NFA, NP vs P would make no sense unless we get the vision on what was people after.
I believe the below way would make it more interesting and fun

1. Start with Logicomix
    - Logicomix is a graphic novel on the adventures of Bertrand Russell. It is beautifully done.
   It has some historical facts fictionalised. Thats not a big deal at all.
   Glide through this book for the initial familiarity of some key words.
   
2. The Universal Computer/Engines of Logic by Martin Davis
    - This is semi-technical book. It deals with history of computation.
   It gives you the context of why computation is important and what were the visions of computation by academicians.
   Some Technical part maybe above your head. Do not care and finish the book. If you still have curiosity, Textbooks are thw way!
3. Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser
    - This is the first textbook. Sipser has done a amazing job at explaining the stuff with little mathematics. 
   Accompany the book with Sipser's Online Lecture. I read a lot in book for the first 200 pages, later on I spent
   more time on lecture than book.
4. The Nature of Computation by Cristopher Moore and Stephan Mertens
    - I would suggest you to read this after completing sipser or half-away through it.
   It gives great intution on lot of ideas but expects a little pre-knowledge. (I am yet to finish this book!)
