On the final days in my bachelors, I had two offers. I had an Electronics engineer role at a Medical Startup in Chennai at 20k per Month and Zoho for 6LPA.
Father, being a businessman said to go for higher pay. I was confused. I understood the reality that we were not very rich. I choose to pick up Zoho as the way forward

I entered Zoho and I found that Sridhar used to do friday TownHalls. It was open and anybody could question anything. The great part was, Sridhar spoke in a comprehensible manner unlike the jargons of usual nerds. I started attending these TownHalls.
He was dealing multiple subjects Philosophy, Lessons on Economics, Technology, Code practices,etc.

He regularly explained that there is a huge bubble and asked us to save money for winters, I had my first itch. I wanted to know how economy and monetary policy works.
I started getting some books on pop-economics and started reading it. Later on, In a TownHal I posted some question and He spoke about 'Immanuel Kant'.
I got the next itch of philosophy.

I also started loving computers following one of Sridhar's Post. He once posted about Godel's Incomplete theorem and some philosophical Implications of it.
It was mind-bending and I immediately wanted to dive deep. It took me into Computation.

Me, Being a young naive kid. I was excited for TownHalls and used to poke all kinds of Question.
I have asked him Why did he want to still work, What does he think human nature is, Why does he have religious belief.
I once had this socratic method of asking 'why' for every axioms (over few townhall sessions!).
Poking the smart mind showed the lens through which they view the world. 

Sridhar used to regularly ruminate on craft of Engineering. He had his idea on how should a good engineer look like.
what should be his traits,etc. 

My major shift has been love for engineering. When I joined, It was all about making some wage and leading a happy private life on weekends.
Sridhar gave this lens on why engineering is hard and Why it is good suffering to take up hard engineering problems and How Engineering could solve the problem of poverty.
