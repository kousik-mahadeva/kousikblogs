These are some personal truths on how hard work occurs. My conviction is hard work is absolutely a trait of Human body and Human Instinct.
Intellect has very little space in this.

My first experience is from a short stint at boxing. I had a wound on the knuckles. Punches were painful and I could not do it very well.
Suddenly after few people made it in and were fighting in the ring, I wanted to be best and Started punching. This time my survival instinct took up. 'You lose if you could not punch 25 times' was the mindset and I was able to get 25 punches without much pain.
Pain was not even in my brain. When you turn on your Lizard brain, Miracle happen!

I found similar cases in world war memoirs. How to get men fighting courageously in spite of blood,death and injuries.
Lot of military theorist answer was 'Survival Instincts'. There are cases where Leader burnt the boats they took for the ride. The soldiers were given a reality. There is one way to stay alive, Kill 'them'.
Survival Instincts created courage of miracles. There are reddit posts of lot of Army veteran saying there were not born courageous. Circumstances build them.

This is also reflected in a sense that lot of hard workers have huge ego. My Idea is ego creates sufficient crises to make them work hard

How to turn on your lizard brain ? (Again Personal Experiences)
1. Eat less
    - Hunger is one of the prime instinct. In this age of abundance, being a little hungry makes us agitated. 
   This has helped me fuel my passion. My experience is hunger makes you move around than anything else.
2. A little Ego
    - The feeling of 'I am worthy to live and I will prove it out'. sounds cliche but I believe when you have a mixed childhood.
   There are people who are running just to prove their worth of life. While this may sound negative, Thanks to Capitalism He could gain his worthiness only by serving to all.
   
I do not know any other way to get hard things done. Intellectual argument pushes us to a extend, post which It has always been Animal Instinct. 
I believe pure rationality is a myth. All of rationality is the by-product of human's instinct for Power (sense of worth) /Fear of Survival.
