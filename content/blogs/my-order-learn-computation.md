This is a user manual on how to approach computation so that you love it.

Sridhar once posted about godel's theorem and its implications in a internal post. This was my first time exposure to theoretical computer science.
It was interesting and deeply philosophical. It was about finding nature of computers, reason and limits of it.

Indian colleges usually teach this in a boring way. Part of the problem is, we are not given any context on why this abstraction of automatons are useful. I beleive the below guide you help you gain interest in a contextual manner.

1. Start with Logicomix
    - Logicomix is a graphic novel on the adventures of Bertrand Russell. You will get the climate of what brilliant minds of 1900s were after.
   It is mostly history with references to work done in the time.
   Some facts are fictionalized, but serves as a great introduction to the field.
   
2. The Universal Computer/Engines of Logic by Martin Davis
    - This is semi-technical book. It builds upon the history with theories and improvements made on them.
   It gives you the context of why computation is important and what were the visions of computation by academicians.
   Some Technical part maybe above your head. Do not care and finish up the book. If you still have curiosity, Textbooks are the way!
3. Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser
    - This is the first textbook. Sipser has done a amazing job at explaining the stuff with little mathematics. 
   Accompany the book with Sipser's Online Lecture. I spent time initially on book (close to 200 pages) to get good foundations
   and later on moved to online lectures.
4. The Nature of Computation by Cristopher Moore and Stephan Mertens
    - I would suggest you to read this after completing sipser or half-away through it.
   It gives great intuition on lot of ideas but expects a little pre-knowledge. (I am yet to finish this book!)
