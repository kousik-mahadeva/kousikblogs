I am a Software Engineer, who slowly started loving the craft of building things.
I spend all my college reading about electronics only to find a job at software engineering. I got into Zoho Corp, which was ambitious and very engineer'y. 
I learnt the art of building things. A bit of philosphy rubbed into me as well!
