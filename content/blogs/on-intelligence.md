What does it take to succeed in life?

All my reading boiled down to two factors: intelligence and hard work.
How much of this is under our control? The traditional 'Nature vs. Nurture' question.

In my schooling days, I just managed to get into 'Topper Section'. I was in the middle-bottom part of the class.
I met people who worked very little but scored extraordinary marks. Their ability to understand complex ideas was astonishing.
They were able to grasp ideas quickly. Some people had the thing to quickly get the pattern and generalize it. When I asked them how they knew it was true,
They were not able to give an answer (asking the best people on 'how they did that' questions is a bad strategy. It comes naturally that they won't be able to give you an answer). The same pattern repeated in university.

Finding all this evidence, it seemed that intelligence is probably the thing that sets apart people who succeed. Again, a lot of books discuss the correlation between IQ and quality of life.

Critics like Nassim Taleb make good points against IQ too. After some threshold, the variance of success is generally not modeled by the equations. It is reasonably scattered to make any serious correlation. I have slowly started realizing this in the current phase of life. Guys who do really well in business are those who have an extreme work ethic.
A lot of CEOs I find are not the smartest person but the most driven one. At least when it comes to money making, work ethics seems to have an edge over innate talent.

My belief is again more philosophical. It totally depends upon the definition of 'success'. If it is about getting every material thing we want, if it is about making money, everyone has a decent chance of making it to the top.
Figuring anything about the nature of reality has to be gifted by nature. Four years down the line from university, I met people from diverse backgrounds. Few 199/200 studying at Anna University and some 185/200 from mediocre colleges. I have seen 185s being a better engineer than 199s. I have seen 185s earning more than 199s.
It all seems that dedication and aspiration could take us a long way than we believe it to be.
