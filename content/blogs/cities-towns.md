I had spent too many days in Chennai now. The rain prediction last week mandated WFH for a week in our office.
I chose to go to Thanjavur to escape Chennai's waterlogging issues. While I always loved rural, this time I was able to dig a little deeper into it.

You got a lot of space and fewer people in towns.
My treatise is that the amount of people cramped inside small urban centers makes people weary.
I believe it removes your agency by a large margin. To see so many people and having to compete with them for resources would instinctively turn away from having a child. Rural towns have far fewer people and a lot fewer rules. You have more sense of control.
Less people and more space make us hopeful of a 'non-scarcity' lifestyle. This is in sync with the data that the number of kids in cities is less than in rural regions.

The nature of life too is vastly different in both regions.
Urban space is where you compete. All your spiritedness gets into the game. The feeling of having to compete with so many people to get your resources. It creates a zero-sum hardcore mindset.
It is about getting things done and what I call the 'executor' mode.

Rural spaces are more laid-back. It has space for reading and reflection. Life is calm enough to observe the universe without the frantic 'me' feeling.
These turn into creativity. Being able to observe facts and knot them into different parts. This is what I call 'creator' mode.

We need both. Phases where you should reflect and learn. You have to be in a deep rural setting. Research centers must be located in regions with lower population density and
should give the psychological safety of rural. Phases where you got to execute/get things done, you ought to be in the city to create sufficient paranoid.
